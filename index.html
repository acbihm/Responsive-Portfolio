        <p>
          I am very interested in creating inventive solutions to optmize and perfect tools that can help me in my nerdy hobbies. Some of these passions include digital painting, playing tabletop RPG games, sell crafts online, and attending video game tournaments. I am currently planning an application to host and smoothly display RPG grid-based maps that I created for the tabletop RPG group that I run!
